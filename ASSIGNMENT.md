# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> Considering I was completely unfamilar with APIs as well as .ini files, much of my learning was just reading about what they are, what they do, and how they are used. Once I understood whata  .ini was then I was able to start reading through the code to do commenting. One large part that made this much easier was a concise and readable readme file. Going through that helped me to understand what kinds of comments I should use and how the different functions interacted. To make it easier I would have disregarded the database examples because they sidetracked my mind to thinking about database objects and connections which was distracting. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Raising abstraction means to explain the higher purpose of the function disregarding technical implementation details. Often times this means specifying what the input was for the function to run and what the result of the function is whether it be a return or other modification. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 12ish


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Shane Miller and I decided to choose the same repo in order to discuss the high level function of this assignment before starting but then split off to do the core workload. We met up towards the end of the project to compare whether we were interpreting the homework assignment correctly because it seemed very abstract and open ended.  


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> When trying to initially run the developer provided examples, I kept getting errors as the files could not find the tap module. TO make the assignment better I would just make everyone work on the same module. This would increase student collaboration and would decrease the number of questions you would have to answer. I also think that a unanimous module assignment would keep everyone on the same page as some modules are harder on certain aspects and easier on others.
